## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)
- Automated version upgrades
- Cross-cluster replication
- Grafana dashboard templates
- Shard scale-in support

## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-22

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Migrated container registry from Docker Hub to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
  - New image path: `ghcr.io/eightynine01/mongodb-operator` (previously `eightynine01/mongodb-operator`)
  - No Docker Hub Secrets required - uses GITHUB_TOKEN automatically
  - Public images with no rate limits for authenticated users
  - Better integration with GitHub Security scanning

### Migration Guide
Existing users need to update image references:
```yaml
# Old (Docker Hub)
image: eightynine01/mongodb-operator:1.0.0

# New (GHCR)
image: ghcr.io/eightynine01/mongodb-operator:1.0.1
```

For Helm users, the repository is automatically updated. Just upgrade:
```bash
helm repo update
helm upgrade mongodb-operator mongodb-operator/mongodb-operator --version 1.0.1
```

### Added
- Documentation: GHCR setup and migration guide (`docs/releases/ghcr-setup.md`)
- E2E testing framework with comprehensive test scripts (`test/e2e/`)
- Extended roadmap with MongoDB Enterprise feature comparison (`ROADMAP.md`)

### Fixed
