## 1. General Settings

### Repository Visibility

- **Setting**: Public
- **Reason**: Open source project requires public visibility for community contributions

### Repository Topics

Add the following topics to improve discoverability:
- `database`
- `mongodb`
- `kubernetes`
- `kubernetes-operator`
- `operator`
- `k8s`
- `mongodb-operator`

### Default Branch

- **Branch**: `main`
- **Reason**: Modern convention, gender-neutral, follows GitHub best practices

### Repository Description

Update the repository description to:
```
A Kubernetes Operator for deploying and managing MongoDB ReplicaSets and Sharded Clusters
```

### Social Preview Settings

- **Description**: MongoDB Operator for Kubernetes - Deploy and manage MongoDB clusters with ease
- **Website**: `https://eightynine01.github.io/mongodb-operator/` (when docs are published)
- **Topics**: As listed above

---

## 2. Branch Protection (main branch)

Navigate to: **Settings → Branches → Add branch protection rule**

### Rule Settings

```
Branch name pattern: main
```

#### Required Checks

**Status Checks**
- ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
- ✅ **Require branches to be up to date before merging**

**Required Checks** (select all):
- `Lint` (from CI workflow)
- `Unit Tests` (from CI workflow)
- `Integration Tests` (from CI workflow)
- `Build` (from CI workflow)
- `Dependency Vulnerability Scan` (from Security Scanning workflow)
- `Container Vulnerability Scan` (from Security Scanning workflow)
- `License Compliance Check` (from Security Scanning workflow)
- `Helm Chart Lint` (from Helm Chart Lint & Test workflow)
- `Helm Chart Test` (from Helm Chart Lint & Test workflow)
- `Docker Build` (from Docker Build & Push workflow - on PRs)

**Additional Settings**:
- Require only these checks to pass (not all)
- Require admins to use status checks

#### Protection Rules

✅ **Require pull request reviews before merging**
- Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
- Require review from Code Owners (when CODEOWNERS is configured)
- Require approval from: 1 reviewer
- Dismiss approving reviews when commits are pushed (recommended)

✅ **Require branches to be up to date before merging**

❌ **Do not enable** (or configure):
- Require conversation resolution before merging
- Require signed commits
- Require linear history (optional, recommended for cleaner history)
- Block force pushes (recommended)
- Allow force pushes (if disabled above)
- Restrict who can push to matching branches (optional)
- Restrict who can dismiss stale PR approvals (optional)

#### Stale PR Handling

Configure automated stale PR closing via a separate workflow or manually:
- Auto-close stale PRs after 30 days of inactivity
- Add `stale` label to inactive PRs after 14 days
- Comment before closing with template

---

## 7. Actions & Permissions

### Permissions Configuration

Navigate to: **Settings → Actions → General**

#### Workflow Permissions

**Setting**: ✅ Read and write permissions

**Rationale**:
- Release workflow needs write permissions to create releases
- Helm publish workflow needs write permissions to push to gh-pages branch
- Security scan workflow needs write permissions to upload SARIF results
- Status checks need write permissions

**Specific Permissions**:
- **Contents**: Read and write
- **Metadata**: Read
- **Pull requests**: Read and write
- **Security events**: Read and write
- **Actions**: Read
- **Checks**: Read and write
- **Dependabot secrets**: Read and write
- **Packages**: Read

---

#### Fork Pull Request Workflows

**Setting**: ✅ Enable workflow permissions for fork pull requests

**Configuration**:
- Read and write permissions
- Provide access to secrets (for testing workflows)
- Allow custom action creation (optional, not recommended)

**Note**: Be careful with secret access for fork PRs. Restrict to only necessary secrets.

---

### Actions Features

#### Actions Settings

✅ **Enabled**: Allow all actions and reusable workflows

✅ **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**: Disabled (security)

✅ **Allow GitHub Actions to run approved pull requests**: Enabled

❌ **Allow reuse and disable from all actions by public actors**: Disabled (security)

---

#### Workflow Run Retention

**Default**: 90 days

**Recommended**: Keep default for compliance and debugging

---

### Branch Permissions

Navigate to: **Settings → Branches**

#### Branch Creation

**Setting**: Allow all collaborators to create branches

**Rationale**: Encourage community contributions

**Alternative**: Restrict to maintainers (if stricter governance needed)

---

#### Tag Creation

**Setting**: Restrict to maintainers only

**Rationale**:
- Tags trigger releases and publishing
- Prevent accidental tags from non-maintainers
- Control versioning

**Configuration**:
- Only maintainers can create tags
- Require tag format: `v*` (semantic versioning)

/docs/ @docs-team

# File patterns
*.go @go-team
*.md @docs-team
.github/ @devops-team
```

---

### DEPENDABOT Configuration

Ensure `.github/dependabot.yml` exists:

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10

---

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

**Weekly**:
- Review Dependabot alerts
- Review and merge Dependabot PRs

**Monthly**:
- Review and close stale issues and PRs
- Update version numbers in templates if needed

**Quarterly**:
- Review branch protection rules
- Review required checks and thresholds
- Update security scanning tools

**On Release**:
- Update version numbers in templates
- Update roadmap in README
- Review and update documentation

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Required Checks Failing

**Problem**: PR cannot merge due to failed checks

**Solutions**:
1. Check workflow logs for specific failure
2. Run workflow locally using `act` (GitHub Actions local runner)
3. Check for environment-specific issues (secrets, permissions)

#### Workflow Permissions Denied

**Problem**: Workflow fails with permission denied error

**Solutions**:
1. Check Actions permissions in repository settings
2. Verify workflow permissions are set to "Read and write"
3. Ensure required secrets are configured

#### Branch Protection Too Strict

**Problem**: Cannot merge PR due to branch protection

**Solutions**:
1. Add admin bypass if needed (use with caution)
2. Temporarily relax restrictions for urgent fixes
3. Review and adjust required checks
