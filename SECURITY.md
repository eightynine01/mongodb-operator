## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security reports seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately to us before disclosing it publicly.

### How to Report

**Preferred Method**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
1. Visit https://github.com/eightynine01/mongodb-operator/security/advisories
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Follow the prompts to submit your report

**Alternative**: Email us directly at security@eightynine01.com

### What to Include

Please include as much detail as possible:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any proof-of-concept or exploit code (if available)

### Privacy

All vulnerability reports are handled with strict confidentiality. Your report will only be shared with the maintainers responsible for addressing the issue. We will not publicly disclose your identity without your permission.

## Security Best Practices for Users

To secure your MongoDB deployments:

1. **Enable TLS**: Always enable TLS encryption for data in transit using cert-manager integration
2. **Strong Authentication**: Use SCRAM-SHA-256 with strong, unique passwords stored as Kubernetes Secrets
3. **RBAC**: Configure proper Kubernetes RBAC to limit operator permissions to least privilege
4. **Network Policies**: Implement network policies to restrict pod-to-pod communication
5. **Regular Updates**: Keep both the operator and underlying MongoDB versions updated
6. **Backup Security**: Secure backup storage credentials and enable encryption for backups
7. **Monitoring**: Enable Prometheus monitoring to detect unusual activity patterns
8. **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate resource limits to prevent DoS attacks

## Security Features of the Operator

The MongoDB Operator includes several security features:

- **TLS Encryption**: Automatic certificate management with cert-manager integration
- **Authentication**: SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication for secure user access
- **Internal Auth**: Keyfile-based authentication for inter-cluster communication
- **RBAC Integration**: Respects Kubernetes RBAC for access control
- **Secret Management**: Stores credentials securely in Kubernetes Secrets
- **Prometheus Monitoring**: Export metrics for security monitoring and alerting
- **Secure Base Image**: Uses distroless Docker images to minimize attack surface
